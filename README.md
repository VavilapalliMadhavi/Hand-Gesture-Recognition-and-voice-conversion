Number about deaf and dumb persons have dramatically increased in recent years due to birth defects, mishaps, & mouth diseases. A dumb person throughout the world uses sign language for communication. People often misinterpret these signals, whether by sign language, lip reading, or lip sync. The best way to present our idea is through speech. Sign Language Recognition (SLR) targets on interpreting the sign language into text and speech, to facilitate the communication between deaf-dumb people and ordinary people. Creating a desktop application that uses a computerâ€™s webcam to capture a person signing gestures for American Sign Language (ASL) and translate it to corresponding text and speech in real time. The translated sign language gesture will be acquired in text which is further converted in audio. In this manner we are implementing a finger spelling sign language translator. This task has broad social impact but is still very challenging due to the complexity and large variations in hand actions. Existing methods for SLR use hand-crafted features to describe sign language motion and build classification models based on those features. However, it is difficult to design reliable features to adapt to the large variations of hand gestures. To approach this problem, we propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) which extracts discriminative spatial-temporal features from raw video stream automatically without any prior knowledge, avoiding designing features. To boost the performance, multi-channels of video streams, including colour information, depth clue, and body joint positions, are used as input to the CNN to integrate colour, depth and trajectory information.
